# Project Prescriptions Manager

In this project, we have the APIs to manage the submissions and prescriptions by Doctors and Patients.

## Description

* Patients can upload their submissions to the server and a specific doctor can view the submission of the patient.
* After the doctor has reviewed the submission, he/she can upload the prescription to the server.
* An email is then sent to the patient to inform him/her that the prescription is ready.
* Patients can download the prescription from the server.
* Patients are free to register and login to the server.
* Doctors have to be invited by the admin to register and login to the server.
